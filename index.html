            <p>Ludwig van Beethoven, German pianist and composer, is widely considered to be one of the greatest musical geniuses of all time. His innovative compositions combined vocals and instruments, widening the scope of sonata, symphony, concerto and quartet. He is the crucial transitional figure connecting the Classical and Romantic ages of Western music.</p>

            <p>Beethoven's personal life is marked by a struggle against deafness, and some of his most important works were composed while he was quite unable to hear.</p>
