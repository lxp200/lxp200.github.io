            <p>Premiering in Vienna on December 8, 1813, the work is considered a notable example of the more ebullient side of Beethoven's compositional personality and evidence that, even after the onset of deafness, he yet found cause for musical optimism.</p>
            
            <p>Beethoven began his Symphony No. 7 in the summer of 1811 in the Bohemian spa city of Teplitz, completing it several months later. He himself conducted the premiere at a concert to benefit Austrian and Bavarian soldiers wounded at the battle of Hanau in the Napoleonic Wars. That same program also featured the premiere of the martial Wellington's Victory. Eventually, Wellington's Victory was dismissed as being of little lasting importance, but the symphony has had a happier history, becoming one of the composer's most popular works.</p>

            <p>Beethoven called the Symphony No. 7 his “most excellent symphony,” and one music critic of the time reported, “this symphony is the richest melodically and the most pleasing and comprehensible of all Beethoven symphonies.” On the dissenting side, Carl Maria von Weber (1786-1826) heard the piece as evidence that its composer had lost his mind, and, Friedrich Wieck (1785-1873), a renowned piano teacher and Clara Schumann's father, maintained that the music could only have been written by someone who was seriously intoxicated.</p>
